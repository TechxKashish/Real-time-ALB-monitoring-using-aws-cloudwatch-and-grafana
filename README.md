# Real-Time ALB Monitoring with AWS CloudWatch & Grafana

## 📌 Overview
This project provides a real-time monitoring solution for an **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)** using **AWS CloudWatch** and **Grafana**. It helps in tracking crucial performance metrics such as request trends, error rates, and latency, enabling proactive issue detection and system optimization.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks request counts, error rates, and response latency.
- **AWS CloudWatch Integration**: Collects and visualizes ALB metrics in real time.
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Dynamic, customizable dashboards for insightful data visualization.
- **Scalability & Cost-Efficiency**: Designed for cost-effective, scalable monitoring.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **AWS CloudWatch** - Collects ALB metrics and logs.
- **Grafana** - Displays real-time monitoring dashboards.
- **AWS IAM** - Manages permissions for accessing CloudWatch.
- **Amazon EC2** - Hosts the monitoring setup.

## 🔧 Setup Guide
### Prerequisites
- An **AWS account** with an **ALB** already set up.
- **CloudWatch logs & metrics** enabled for ALB.
- **Grafana** installed (can be self-hosted or AWS Managed Grafana).

### Step 1: Enable ALB Logging in AWS CloudWatch
1. Navigate to **AWS CloudWatch** → Logs → Create a Log Group.
2. Configure **ALB access logs** to push data into this log group.

### Step 2: Set Up IAM Permissions
1. Create an **IAM role** with policies to read CloudWatch metrics.
2. Attach this role to the instance running Grafana.

### Step 3: Install & Configure Grafana
1. Install Grafana on an **EC2 instance** (or use AWS Managed Grafana).
2. Add **CloudWatch as a data source** in Grafana.
3. Import or create dashboards to visualize ALB metrics.

## 📌 Example Dashboard Views
